# Known Issues

- "Keep" and "Drop" options are currently broken: they keep the first and last dice, not the highest and lowest (this broke when sorting of dice was removed).

If you encounter issues not listed above, please report them in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/Craig-Macomber/game-tools/issues).
