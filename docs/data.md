# Data

## Privacy

We do not want your data.
This application does not use any cookies.
The data entered into this tool stays on your computer.

When using "Save to URL" the data is appended to the URL as a [URI fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment).
This allows bookmarking the tool prefilled with the desired text, but the actual data is never sent off your computer
(unless you do so yourself, for example by adding a bookmark then syncing that with a service).

When saving to "Local Storage", that refers to your browser's Local Storage for the site, which is part of [Web storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage) standard.
Again this is local to your browser.

This website is hosted by GitHub: they might track your access to the site, but we have no access to that data.
This means we have no way to know if or how you use it, or if you run into any issues.
If you run into any issues, we will have no way to know about them unless you report them.
See [known issues](./known-issues.md) for details.

## Access and Compatibility

We recommend you always keep a copy of your data in a format you can understand.
This project is done for fun, and little effort will be made to ensure the data formats used by these tools continue to work in future versions.
It's recommended to always keep a copy of any data you wish to retain in a format you can interpret yourself without relying on these tools.
Keeping your data in local text files is probably ideal but not the only way to do this.
If using the local storage feature, learn how to use your browsers dev tools to read the data from the browser without using this website: it is kept in a human readable format.
If using the URL based storage, it can be decoded using any standard url decode tool.
